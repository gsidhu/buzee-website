To easily access search with Buzee...

##### Include/Exclude from Search
- Put quotes around keyword(s) to search for the exact phrase (like `"annual report"`)
- Put a hyphen in front of the keyword to exclude it from search (like `"annual report" -2022 -pdf`)

##### Search using Time
Simply mention the date/time period that you are looking for in your search. For example:

<ul>
  <li><code><strong>last month</strong> pdf invoice</code></li>
  <li><code>annual report ppt <strong>this year</strong></code></li>
  <li><code><strong>q2 2023 to q3 2023</strong> retail report xlsx</code></li>
  <li><code>prelim findings <strong>from 2017 to 2022</strong></code></li>
  <li><code>cv docx <strong>march 2 2020 to aug 2021</strong> -pdf</code></li>
  <li><code>scope study <strong>14/02/2015 to 10/08/2015</strong></code></li>
</ul>

If you want to use a Time keyword but don't want to set the time filter, simply wrap it in quotes like this - `invoice "March 2022"`
