"Efficiency Uninterrupted: Customize Your Buzee Shortcut!"
Buzee is your go-to solution for lightning-fast file searches, but what if you could make it even faster? 

With Buzee's customizable global shortcut feature, you can call Buzee with a simple keyboard shortcut, eliminating the need to navigate through menus or search for icons on your desktop.

Here's why it's a game-changer:

1. **Instant Access**: Buzee's global shortcut feature allows you to open the app with lightning speed, eliminating the need to navigate through menus or search for icons on your desktop. With just a quick key combination, you can have Buzee up and running in an instant, ready to help you find your files faster than ever. The default shortcut is `Option/Alt + Space`, but you can easily customize it to suit your preferences.

2. **Personalized Experience**: We understand that every user's preferences are different. That's why we've made it easy for you to customize your Buzee shortcut to suit your needs. Whether you prefer a different key combination or the default shortcut clashes with another app on your computer, Buzee gives you the flexibility to choose what works best for you.

3. **Simple Setup**: Changing your Buzee shortcut is a breeze. Simply head to the Settings menu and click on the shortcut in the "Allow Global Shortcut" section.

From there, you'll be presented with a modal where you can set your preferred modifier and key combination. With options for up to two modifiers, you can tailor your shortcut to fit seamlessly into your existing workflow.
